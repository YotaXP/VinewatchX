Vinewatch X Desktop Notification and Live Status Poller

Summary
=======

Vinewatch started as a program to determine the live status of the Vinesauce.com TwitchTV stream's live status. Over the past 2 years, I (H. Bristow aka Aliababwah) have been passively developing this horrid little program in C# for the Jabronis over at my favourite stream. Here's a link to the forum thread:

A fact that simply cannot be said enough, but is worth stating again, is that I am NOT a programmer. I am a Networking guy, as in Cisco, Juniper and friends. Coding is just something I picked up during the journey of academic persuit. As such, I request that those of you who do rifle through my code, do so with strict composure regarding my practices. My code is horrid, and beleive me, I know this. C# is like the Duplo of Object Orientated languages, and with a basic understanding of a classful approach to programming, nasty little projects like Vinewatch X will emerge.

As of today (2014-07-02), the project was moved to Github for the developing pleasure of those far more skilled than I am. This act is something that I hope will promote a better quality of development for Vinewatch X, as there is only so much a Networking student can do in a programming environment. The large interest in contribution is some to which this movement should cater towards, and I hope that my shitty little program will prosper into a blooming masterpeice of a tiny program.
