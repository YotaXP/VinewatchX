"THE BEER-WARE LICENSE 2" (Revision of H. Bristow):

As long as you retain this notice you can do almost whatever you want.
 
If ever you should use this program, you are held under the one
simple rule of this license, and by using the program you agree to adhere
to said rule.

If ever you should derive code from this program, you are to cite me as
influence for your project, and by doing such you agree to adhere to the one 
rule.

Imposed rule - For each single user that uses the program, one beer is to
be bought as a gift to the programmer, should ever their paths (User and
programmer) cross.

Failure to adhere to the rule in your call to serve will lead to a user being 
publicly shamed in the distribution/version notes and on the Vinesauce forums.

This program was created for www.vinesauce.com, a streaming website.
